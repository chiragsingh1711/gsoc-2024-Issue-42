# Project Overview

## Summary:

The project aims to develop a series of small scripts for Blender that automate the creation of visual animations for construction sequencing. Construction firms often require the ability to visualize project timelines, linking tasks to 3D objects in a seamless manner. This project focuses on automating the animation process, allowing for the automatic generation of animations where building elements appear, disappear, change locations, or stagger their appearances based on the project timeline.

## Objective:

The primary goal is to create a set of Python scripts that integrate with Blender, enabling the animation of visibility, locations, and appearances of building elements in synchronization with a project timeline. These scripts will leverage basic knowledge of animation principles, particularly keyframing, and utilize the capabilities of Blender for seamless integration.

## Expected Outcome:

The project will yield a set of scripts capable of automatically generating animations from Blender, showcasing the dynamic nature of construction projects. The scripts will enable the manipulation of object visibility, locations, and staggered appearances, providing construction firms with a powerful tool for visualizing their projects. Additionally, basic scripts will be developed to correlate real-world time to animation frames and frames per second, allowing for accurate representation of project timelines.
